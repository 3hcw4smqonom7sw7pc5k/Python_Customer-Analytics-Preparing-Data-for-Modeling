Specifically, they have set the following requirements:\n\n    Columns containing categories with only two factors must be stored as Booleans (bool).\n    Columns containing integers only must be stored as 32-bit integers (int32).\n    Columns containing floats must be stored as 16-bit floats (float16).\n    Columns containing nominal categorical data must be stored as the category data type.\n    Columns containing ordinal categorical data must be stored as ordered categories, and not mapped to numerical values, with an order that reflects the natural order of the column.\n    The DataFrame should be filtered to only contain students with 10 or more years of experience at companies with at least 1000 employees, as their recruiter base is suited to more experienced professionals at enterprise companies.\n\nIf you call .info() or .memory_usage() methods on ds_jobs and ds_jobs_transformed after you've preprocessed it, you should notice a substantial decrease in memory usage.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9dbed0b9-66fe-4546-b44c-46b35e51715c"},{"source":"How to approach the project\n\n1. Exploratory data analysis\n\nLoad customer_train.csv to begin exploring the data to understand the contents and data types of the values in each column.\nHow to find the data types and contents of a column\n\n    You can check the column names and assigned data types by calling .info() on the DataFrame.\n    The .value_counts() method can be used to view the unique values and counts present in a column.\n\nHow to determine what a columns data type should be\n\n    Columns containing only two unique values with yes/no style values (two-factor categories), should be converted to the bool data type.\n    Columns containing a small number of unique values with no natural ordering should be set to the category data type, as they contain nominal categorical data.\n    Columns containing categorical data with a natural ordering should be converted to ordered categories, as they contain ordinal categorical data.\n\n2. Converting integers, floats, and unordered categories\n\nConvert columns containing integers to the int32 type, floats to the float16 type, nominal categories to the category type, and two-factor categories to the bool type.\nConverting data types\n\n    The .astype() method can be called on a DataFrame column to convert its data type.\n    For converting the two-factor categories, there are a few methods to approach this, but one of the quickest is to create a dictionary to map the existing values to the desired ones.\n    To map values in a Series to new values, call the .map() method on the Series, passing it a dictionary with the following structure:\n\n\n{\n    'current_value1': 'new_value1',\n    'current_value2': 'new_value2'\n}\n\n\n3. Converting ordered categories\n\nConvert columns containing ordinal categorical data into ordered categories.\nCreating ordered categorical data types\n\n    To create an ordered categorical data type, use the pd.CategoricalDtype() function, which takes two arguments: an ordered list of categories (as strings), and ordered, which takes a Boolean indicating if the categories should be ordered.\n\n    For each ordinal column, you'll need to create its own ordered categorical data type, with categories ordered to reflect their natural ordering (from lowest to highest). For example, to create an ordered category for a column containing Olympic medal results, you could use:\n\n\n    medals = pd.CategoricalDtype(['Bronze', 'Silver', 'Gold'], ordered=True)\n\nCreating an ordered list of work experience values\n\n    In ascending order, the work experience values should be <1, then the numbers one through to twenty, then finish with >20.\n    There are lots of ways to create this list:\n        You could use the .unique() and .sort() methods on the column, then convert to a list and rearrange to ensure <1 and >20 are in the correct position.\n        Create a list of numbers 1-20, map the numbers to strings, and concatenate [\"<1\"] and [\">20\"] to the beginning and end, respectively.\n\nConverting columns into ordered categorical columns\n\n    For each ordered categorical column, you'll need to convert its data type using .astype() and the data type object created with pd.CategoricalDtype().\n\n4. Filtering on ordered categorical columns\n\nFilter the DataFrame to only contain students with 10 or more years of experience at companies with at least 1000 employees.\nFiltering DataFrames on ordered categorical columns\n\n    Ordered categorical columns and numerical columns can be filtered using comparison operators such as >.\n    You can combine multiple filters with an & operator.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"496c0837-bd5d-4102-b3be-187370db87d9"},{"source":"![Two data scientists working on a dashboard.](hr-image-small.png)\n\nA common problem when creating models to generate business value from data is that the datasets can be so large that it can take days for the model to generate predictions. Ensuring that your dataset is stored as efficiently as possible is crucial for allowing these models to run on a more reasonable timescale without having to reduce the size of the dataset.\n\nYou've been hired by a major online data science training provider called *Training Data Ltd.* to clean up one of their largest customer datasets. This dataset will eventually be used to predict whether their students are looking for a new job or not, information that they will then use to direct them to prospective recruiters.\n\nYou've been given access to `customer_train.csv`, which is a subset of their entire customer dataset, so you can create a proof-of-concept of a much more efficient storage solution.
